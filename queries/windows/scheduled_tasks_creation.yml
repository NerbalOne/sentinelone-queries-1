title: Scheduled Tasks Creation
description: Our goal with this query is to detect any schtasks /create command as
  well as any use of the New-ScheduledTask* cmdlets from powershell, and to prevent
  noise from services and updates we'll exclude a list of system "trusted" SrcProcParentName
  executables.
