title: Clear Windows Event Logs
description: Detects the clearing of EventLogs through wevtutil (concise) as well
  as Clear-EventLog through CommandLine and CommandScript objects. Powershell cmdlet
  detection returns a lot of noise for the CommandScripts object, so filtering out
  SrcProcParentName may be required.
